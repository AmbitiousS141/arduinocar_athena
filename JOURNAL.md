# Project Journal
## Total hardware time: 5 hours 13 minutes
#### Session 1 (3 hours 14 minutes)
Gathered all my materials and started at 10:40 in the morning :D

I built a chassis, mounted the wheels and motors, drilled holes to arrange wires, and drilled more holes to mount the battery cell.  

My neighbor, previously an electrical engineer, helped me out quite a lot in both this session and the next. For this one, if he didn't have possibly every tool of every size in the world in one garage, I likely wouldn't have finished this project TT. My bolt and screw sizes were very picky :/  

He also brought over a multimeter and taught me how to use it by testing out batteries and switches. We spent a lot of this session's time by planning for the next one with the multimeter :D  

When I asked him for tips on wiring, he told me to simply make it look organized and professional. He also showed me a few different arrangements with the setup I had then.  

I got hungry and ended the session at 1:54 for a lunch break. By then, Swoop looked like this:

#### Session 2 (1 hour 59 minutes)
Forgot to take a picture when I came back at 2:15 :C sorry y'all  

I started by mounting the L298N on the chassis. Oh how this made me wish I wish I had a 3D printer; I built the section that would keep the motor driver on using cardboard instead. I then connected the motor's wires to the outputs, where my neighbor helped me out some more by teaching me how it's done and reminding me to yank at the wires when you've tightened the screw to make sure they're secure. After that, he taught me how to solder wires - and I used this to set up the switch. I was also taught multiple ways to cut wires' protective case - with a wire stripper, a side cutter, or even using a soldering iron to melt it off. That last method proved to be most efficient XD Finally, I set up and connected the Arduino and IR sensor in the same way as the motor driver TT.

I adjusted the wires to be more neat, and *that's* when I decided what to title this project. Then I ran off for dessert (have you ever heard of savarines? You really need to try them) at 4:14. The hardware part was all done!
